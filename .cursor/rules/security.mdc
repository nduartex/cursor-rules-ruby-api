# Security Rules

- Use Devise for authentication.
- Apply `before_action :authenticate_user!` in controllers.
- Do not expose sensitive data in JSON responses.

# API Versioning Rules

- Version APIs in the URL (e.g.: `/api/v1/resource`).
- Maintain compatibility with previous versions.
- Clearly document changes between versions.
- Use headers to indicate API version in responses.
